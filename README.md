```

**Request flow:** Frontend (Axios, JWT attached) → FastAPI router (auth + role check) →
Pydantic validation → Service layer (business rules) → SQLAlchemy ORM → PostgreSQL.
The response travels back through the same layers in reverse.

## Roles & Access Model

| Role | Created by | Approval needed | Key permissions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **System Admin** | Seeded once via CLI script | No | Manages institutions, creates Institution Admins, platform-wide analytics |
| **Institution Admin** | System Admin | No — forced password reset | Approves researchers, manages departments/reviewers, institution-scoped reports |
| **Researcher** | Public self-registration | **Yes** — by Institution Admin | Publications, collaborations, conference registration, citations |
| **Reviewer** | System Admin / Institution Admin | No — forced password reset | Claims and reviews submitted publications |

Registration flow: Researcher registers → `PENDING` status → Institution Admin approves →
`APPROVED` → login unlocked.

---

## Getting Started (Local Setup)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- Node.js 20+
- A PostgreSQL database (local, or free tier on [Neon](https://neon.tech))
- A Gmail account with an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) (for email/OTP/CAPTCHA-adjacent features)
- A free [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://dash.cloudflare.com) widget (for CAPTCHA)
- A free [Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) (for AI summaries)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Scientific-Collaboration-Network-Analyzer-Group-1
```

### 2. Backend setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
```

Create `backend/.env` (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below).

```bash
alembic upgrade head
python -m app.db.seed_admin <username> <email> <password>   # creates first System Admin

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` — API docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### 3. Frontend setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create `frontend/.env`:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=<your Turnstile site key>
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 4. First login
1. Log in as the System Admin you seeded
2. Create an Institution (System Admin dashboard)
3. Create a Department for that institution
4. Create an Institution Admin (System Admin dashboard) — check the email inbox for temporary credentials
5. Register a Researcher account publicly at `/register`
6. Log in as the Institution Admin, approve the pending researcher
7. Log in as the Researcher — you now have full access to publications, conferences, and collaborations

---

## Running with Docker

The entire application (backend + frontend) can be run in containers via Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running

### Steps

1. Create a `.env` file at the **project root** (same folder as `docker-compose.yml`) with
   all the variables listed in [Environment Variables](#environment-variables).

2. From the project root:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. Access:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Backend API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

4. To stop:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

Uploaded publication files persist across container restarts via a named Docker volume
(`uploads_data`).

### Docker Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Docker Compose
        F[frontend container<br/>Nginx + built React app<br/>:5173 to :80]
        B[backend container<br/>Uvicorn + FastAPI<br/>:8000]
        V[(Named volume<br/>uploads_data)]
    end
    N[Neon PostgreSQL<br/>Cloud, external]

    F -- "API calls" --> B
    B -- "reads/writes" --> V
    B -- "SQL over internet" --> N
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (backend, and root for Docker) with:

```dotenv
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/dbname?sslmode=require

# Auth
SECRET_KEY=<generate with: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))">
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=480

# CAPTCHA (Cloudflare Turnstile)
TURNSTILE_SECRET=<your Turnstile secret key>

# Email (Gmail SMTP example)
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=<Gmail App Password>
MAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_STARTTLS=True
MAIL_SSL_TLS=False

# AI Summaries
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your Gemini API key>
```

> **Security note:** never commit `.env` to git. All values above are real credentials —
> treat them the same way you would a password.

## API Documentation

Full interactive API documentation is auto-generated by FastAPI and available at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs        (local)
http://localhost:8000/docs        (Docker)
```

This provides a live Swagger UI where every endpoint can be tested directly, including
request/response schemas, required auth, and example payloads.

### Endpoint groups

| Group | Base path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication | `/auth` | Login (MFA-gated), OTP verification, password reset |
| Users | `/users` | Registration, approval, role-based creation |
| Institutions | `/institutions` | CRUD |
| Departments | `/departments` | CRUD, institution-scoped |
| Researchers | `/researchers` | Profile management, search |
| Publications | `/publications` | Full lifecycle, file upload/download, browse |
| Citations | `/publications/{id}/citations` | Add/view/edit/delete |
| Conferences | `/conferences` | CRUD, registration, participants |
| Collaborations | `/collaborations` | Send/accept/reject, chat messages |
| Reports | `/reports` | Researcher/publication/conference reports, exports |
| Analytics | `/analytics` | Platform-wide summary stats |
| Notifications | `/notifications` | List, mark read, delete |

## AI Contributions

This project was built with substantial assistance from Claude (Anthropic), used for:

- Architectural guidance on backend layering (routes → services → models) and role-based
  access control design
- Debugging real issues encountered during development, including Alembic migration
  history conflicts, FastAPI route-ordering bugs, and async/event-loop errors
- Code generation for backend endpoints, services, and database models
- Frontend component design and styling, including the design token system
- Writing this documentation, including the architecture and ER diagrams

The **AI-powered publication summary feature itself** (using Google's Gemini API) is a
distinct, separate feature of the application — built by a team member — allowing
researchers to generate an AI-written summary of their publication's abstract.

## Known Limitations

- MFA requires a valid, deliverable email address on the account — test accounts created
  with placeholder emails cannot complete login
- File uploads are stored on local/container disk, not cloud object storage — files
  uploaded to one backend instance are not visible to another running instance unless
  both point at the same deployed backend
- Chat uses polling (checks every few seconds) rather than WebSockets — adequate at
  current scale, not truly real-time
- No automated test suite yet
- HTTPS is not yet configured — currently runs over HTTP in local/Docker environments

---

## Future Scope

- HTTPS deployment on a cloud platform (Render/Railway) with a custom domain
- Migrate publication file storage to cloud object storage (e.g. S3-compatible) so
  uploads are accessible regardless of which backend instance handles the request
- Automated backend test suite (pytest) and CI pipeline
- WebSocket-based real-time chat instead of polling
- Push notifications (browser) in addition to in-app and email
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Audit log module for tracking administrative actions in detail
